## Introduction

I'm Sophia Jenkinson, a passionate data professional currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data, Inequality, and Society at the University of Edinburgh. My academic journey and professional experiences have equipped me with strong data engineering and analysis skills, which I utilize to derive insights and inform strategic decision-making.

I have hands-on experience with a variety of tools, including SQL, Python, and R, as well as advanced data visualization platforms like Tableau and Power BI. My recent work includes a data science research role with The City of Edinburgh Council, where I developed automated data flows and created dashboards to improve decision-making processes. Previously, I contributed to Raytheon Technologies' internal audit function, enhancing data analysis workflows and producing dashboards used in production.

At Pacific Lutheran University, I served as a Data Analyst Intern, conducting exploratory data analysis to inform admission and marketing strategies. With a strong foundation in data science, statistical modeling, and data visualization, coupled with certifications in Alteryx and Google Data Analytics, I am committed to leveraging my skills to drive meaningful insights in any data-focused role.
