## Introduction

I'm Sophia, a data analyst pursuing a Master's degree in Data, Inequality, and Society from the University of Edinburgh, with a strong foundation in data analysis and statistical modeling. At Pacific Lutheran University, I served as a data analyst intern for the Office of Admission, where I conducted exploratory data analysis and utilized R, SQL, and Tableau to inform future admission and marketing strategies for the university. With my proficiency in programming languages for data analysis and manipulation, along with my acquired Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I bring solid analytical skills and passion to any data analysis team.
